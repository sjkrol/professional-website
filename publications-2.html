                    Infinite Colours" brings 2,499 videogame titles into a slow canvas of accumulative light. Each game adds a unique shape and colour onto the canvas and plays a unique string of notes. Over 8 hours, the canvas will be filled with infinite colours to celebrate LGBTQIA+ independent videogames.
                    History has always been queer. Through this generative visual and sound work, we aim to demonstrate the collective activism, movement, and creative expressions that queer folks are making to be visible, heard, and to say that we are here.
                    But queer movement does not happen overnight; queer resistance is accumulative and built over generations of selfsacrifice and self-acceptance. The multitude intersectionality of the unruly times slowly bleeds colour into the world, blends motion into the landscape, and accumulatively becomes a canvas of evermoving colourful light.

                    In creative design, where aesthetics play a crucial role in determining the quality of outcomes, there are often multiple worthwhile possibilities,
                    rather than a single "best" design. This challenge is compounded in the use of computational generative systems, where the sheer number of potential outcomes can be overwhelming.
                    This paper introduces a method that combines evolutionary optimisation with AI-based image classification to perform quality-diversity search, allowing for the creative exploration of
                    complex design spaces. The process begins by randomly sampling the genotype space, followed by mapping the generated phenotypes to a reduced representation of the solution space, as well
                    as evaluating them based on their visual characteristics. This results in an elite group of diverse outcomes that span the solution space. The elite is then progressively updated via sampling
                    and simple mutation. We tested our method on a generative system that produces abstract drawings. The results demonstrate that the system can effectively evolve populations of phenotypes with
                    high aesthetic value and greater visual diversity compared to traditional optimisation-focused evolutionary approaches.

                    In recent years Generative Machine Learning systems have advanced significantly. A current wave of generative systems use text prompts to create complex imagery, video, even 3D datasets.
                    The creators of these systems claim a revolution in bringing creativity and art to anyone who can type a prompt. In this position paper, we question the basis for these claims, dividing our
                    analysis into three areas: the limitations of linguistic descriptions, implications of the dataset, and lastly, matters of materiality and embodiment. We conclude with an analysis of the
                    creative possibilities enabled by prompt-based systems, asking if they can be considered a new artistic medium.

                    Open AI’s language model, GPT-3, has shown great potential for many NLP tasks, with applications in many different domains. In this work we carry out a first study on GPT-3’s capability to
                    communicate musical decisions through textual explanations when prompted with a textual representation of a piece of music. Enabling a dialogue in human-AI music partnerships is an important
                    step towards more engaging and creative human-AI interactions. Our results show that GPT-3 lacks the necessary intelligence to really understand musical decisions. A major barrier to reach a better
                    performance is the lack of data that includes explanations of the creative process carried out by artists for musical pieces. We believe such a resource would aid the understanding and collaboration
                    with AI music systems.

                    We present a system that automatically generates music
                    from visual art based on the perceived emotion of the
                    given input. We propose the generated music as a framing device that can enhance the aesthetic experience of
                    people viewing Computational Creativity (CC) outputs.
                    In this paper, we carry out a first study to test this by
                    comparing the aesthetic experience of viewing paintings generated by CC systems accompanied by either
                    textual framing, our proposed musical framing or both.
                    We evaluate our system by means of qualitative user
                    evaluations, which require participants to rank their aesthetic experience from best to worst. The results from
                    the study demonstrated that the musical framing generated by our system provided a better aesthetic experience for users compared to the textual framing. Furthermore, the results suggest that with more work, a combination of textual and musical framing could be used
                    to further improve the aesthetic experience for people
                    viewing visual CC art.
